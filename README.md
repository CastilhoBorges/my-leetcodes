# My LeetCode Challenges 🚀

Welcome to my repository for LeetCode problem solutions!

This project serves as a personal log of my progress and studies in algorithms and data structures. Each solution is a step in my journey to become a more efficient and proficient problem-solver.

## 🎯 Goal

- **To practice and sharpen** problem-solving skills.
- **To maintain an organized archive** of solutions for future reference.
- **To document** different approaches and analyze their complexities (Big O).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run the solutions locally, please follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js **version 22 or higher** installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CastilhoBorges/my-leetcodes.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-leetcodes
    ```

3.  Install all necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## 📁 Project Structure

The file organization is designed to be scalable and easy to navigate. Each LeetCode challenge is located in its own directory inside `src/`, following this pattern:

```
/
├── src/
│   ├── two-sum/
│   │   ├── README.md         (Problem-specific explanation and logic)
│   │   ├── solution-{number}.ts       (Solution code in TypeScript)
│   └── ... (other challenges will follow the same pattern)
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

To run a specific solution file:
```bash
npx tsx src/two-sum/solution-1.ts
```
